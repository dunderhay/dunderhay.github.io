title: "CVE-2019-8074 Path Traversal in Adobe ColdFusion"
layout: post
tags: [bugs]
excerpt: "Access Control Bypass via Path Taversal"
---

Last year I discovered a fairly simple Path Traversal bug in Adobe ColdFusion. Due to the vulnerability being discovered at work and without any source code, details are extremely vague.

A custom web application created with Adobe ColdFusion 2018 had the ColdFusion admin portal whitelisted. Any attempts to go to the admin portal `https://example.com/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm` would result in a redirect to the main page of the application.

The idea came from watching a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28xWcRegncw) from [Orange Tsai](https://twitter.com/orange_8361) on exploiting URL parsers. More info [here](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Orange-Tsai-Breaking-Parser-Logic-Take-Your-Path-Normalization-Off-And-Pop-0days-Out-2.pdf).

Using `..;/` it was possible to bypass the whitelisting rule and access the ColdFusion admin portal. For example: `https://example.com/..;/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm`

The bug was rated as critical by Adobe, I am unsure if this relates to the Command Injection bug discovered by Badcode of Knownsec 404 Team (CVE-2019-8073) at roughly the same time or if I missed something else completely.
